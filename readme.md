# World War One Letters
## Intro

The goal of this project is to look at English World War One letters and do some
sentiment analysis on them and see if anything can be determined by that analysis.

As usual, I got the dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/anthaus/world-war-i-letters#letters.json

I may also do something with this Kaggle dataset at a later time:
https://www.kaggle.com/docsouth-data/first-person-narratives-of-the-american-south#fpn-ashby-ashby.txt
Which deals with information from the American South.
